Hey Brandon!
This is Pato :)

First of all, I'm excited that you've got everything set up and working!
Second, unfortunately I am having issues opening your test level.

I tried doing what you specified, I believe I opened CustomStuff.upk and Johns_Ocean.upk. I went to File->Import-> and then did each individually. I dont really know what to do with a UPK so thats the issue :P Nonetheless, I tried opening the file afterwards and my UDK Editor crashed..

Besides the obvious issue that I don't know what to do with UPKs, I also imagine that my UDK is outdated. 

Any suggestions?

Cheers!


Okay, I think I might have a solution!

1. Make sure you do have the latest version of UDK, as it contains many new features and updated tools. I used the
   "landscape" tool to make my test level, which I think is a relatively new feature.
2. I believe that you don't actually need to import a .upk file, just open it instead, because it is already a compiled 
   package that can be opened. The only time I ever use import is if I made a texture in photoshop or model in Maya/3Ds,
   because when you import something you technically have to put it into a package (.upk) I'm pretty sure you couldn't 
   store a package within a new package (is that packaged squared? lol). That might be the main reason.
3. As with my test level, it is a VERY large map (by far the largest I have worked on) and such might consume a lot of
   memory to run/load it all. Plus I have a difficult time with the building the lighting for it.
4. Nevertheless, my best solution is to highly recomend that you make sure you have the latest version of UDK, because there are many new features that have 
   been implemented into it. Running a later version of a software on a earlier version might be the source of the crash...

Hope that helps! :D
