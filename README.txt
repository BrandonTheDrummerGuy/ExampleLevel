Hey Brandon!
This is Pato :)

First of all, I'm excited that you've got everything set up and working!
Second, unfortunately I am having issues opening your test level.

I tried doing what you specified, I believe I opened CustomStuff.upk and Johns_Ocean.upk. I went to File->Import-> and then did each individually. I dont really know what to do with a UPK so thats the issue :P Nonetheless, I tried opening the file afterwards and my UDK Editor crashed..

Besides the obvious issue that I don't know what to do with UPKs, I also imagine that my UDK is outdated. 

Any suggestions?

Cheers!
